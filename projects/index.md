Here are couple of projects I had came across!

## NodeJS Api for BMTC

Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation BMTC recently released its Intelligent Transport System (ITS) , But as of now there is no public api available . This is an reverse engineering approach to solve the issue.

```js
npm install bmtc-js-api

var bmtc = require('bmtc-js-api');

...
```


<div markdown="0"><a href="https://nodei.co/npm/bmtc-js-api/"><img src="https://nodei.co/npm/bmtc-js-api.png"></a></div>

**This is an un official api**
