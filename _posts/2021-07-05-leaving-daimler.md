> Mercedes Benz Research and Development India(MBRDI) was like my second home. I enjoyed every bit of work I was doing here. The work experience at Daimler is priceless. Making a decision to move out from MBRDI and Daimler was tough. This is both in-terms of colleagues and work. Sometimes we take strong decision - to move on. Let me walk through my wonderful Journey at MBRDI.

## Joining 

24<sup>th</sup> September 2018, Monday - The day was really special in two ways. First day at MBRDI as well as my birthday.  
Reporting time was 7:15 AM at office. Reached around 6:55 AM. Got the temp id card, and waited in the lobby for the HR to lead us. 
Office reception is stunning. Had breakfast from cafeteria, and moved along with the joining group. Joining process was hassle free and motivating. 

That was two day's of induction. Collected the laptop. Figured out building and cubicle location. Called the buddy(contact person from team) to know the exact place.
Met him, he walked us to the team. Also asked us(there was another person joining along with me) to choose the cubicle we want, as there were several free cubicle.
I took the one, which was besides me. It all started from there.


## Settling
In the initial days, I did what most of us do in the new company. Building a network within the team. Walking through code base of existing projects. 
Attending team meetings like reading Greek. Going through intranet pages. Understanding corporate policies, blah, blah, blah,...

But soon I got assigned to a project `DD` - which changed my career at MBRDI.

## Leading

`DD` is all about saving, viewing, editing and archiving 2D drawings. Working in an organization which invented the `Car` means, there will be lots of engineering drawings involved. Drawings from the age of my grand grand grand father till now. 

Our team consist of two sub teams. Our counter parts at Germany and we in India. My responsibility is leading the development in India.

The project was in a kind of in its initial state when I was about to take lead. The heterogenous stack made it more complex. 
Tech stack includes Java, Javascript, C#, XSLT,...
C# and XSLT was new to me. C# felt more like a sibling of Java. 
If you are good in Java, you can read C# code easily. 

Being a lead doesn't mean that I have deep knowledge in all the technology involved. Nevertheless, its good to know all the languages in surface level. Having a basic understanding of each language helps in understanding pros and cons of each. More about language agnostics can be found on my previous [blog](/2018-05-01-being-language-agnostic/).

Understanding the project end to end was my next task. Its a lot to understand from different team members. It took some time. Like 2 months.
 Every time I try to understand the process and the code, I was trying to answer following questions to myself.
- What is implemented?
- What is the user's expectation of the implementation?

---

There is a cardinal module responsible for visualization. We figured out that its worth rewriting the module. 
Primary reason being, difficulty in scaling and maintaining the module in coming years.
It was a `bold`, `risky` and `worth` move done by the team. Let me brief.

* Bold - It will take 6 month to re write existing features. A visible difference can be seen only in 12 months!
* Risky - We opt to rewrite the project in `react`. None of the team member have prior experience in react. Which means we are on our own.
* Worth - At the end of implementation, module got 5x faster and 20x better in handling data.

> Lesson Learned : 
> - Take calculated risks.
> - Explore more than one alternative solution.
> - Have some statistical data of each approaches we are following.
> - The numbers speaks better than buzz words. eg: say `1 GB of data can be rendered in 10 seconds` compared to `Using advanced rendering technique which make use of virtual DOM blah blah blah...`

Sometimes we have to take risks. 
Fortunately in our case risks paid of well. But that doesn't mean that failure is inevitable. 
Sometimes, I was skeptical of success. The team's aspiration and
our dream of project's success masked the thoughts of failure, virtually and literally.

Few other things we were doing was...
* Full CI-CD pipeline.
* Automated and manual code reviews.
* In code - in depth documentation.

---
Eventually I got a chance to lead the module responsible for 3D rendering as well. Unfortunately I could not take it further, as I have already opted to move out of Daimler. 


## Travelling 

Our travels are generally to Stuttgart, Germany.

![DE5](/img/posts/leaving-daimler/de5.jpg)


The weather at Stuttgart is at finest sometimes. It will be around 12 to 15 degree celsius. You could feel the breath vapour. Ambling on the streets, when the mild breeze give you a tight hug. Sometimes these are best enjoyed with your family, but again business trips.
Streets are clean as water from Alps. Roads are well maintained. Atmosphere is spotless. The breath we take feels naturally sweet. Public transport is at its best. You can see the pristine stream of water flowing underneath the roads. 
Tulips of vivid colors are scattered along the streets. Its a feeling to be felt.

The primary reason for the country being neat and tidy is culture of the people. Germans treat the house and surroundings the same way. 
People obey and respect the rules. The same is done by authority as well. Getting drinkable water on public tap is not a luxury, its the
 fundamental right of people.

Office was at a walkable 3 KM from the hotel. Sometimes we walk, and some times we take Bus. While walking you will see exclusive walk ways
for people who walk and cycles. Its a calm and relaxing feel to walk on the roads. After the long walk, when you reach office its a warm welcome.
I mean the warmth of heater is a absolute pleasure, especially when its snowing outside.

#### German Time
So there was a meeting at Esslingen(~40Km from office), which we need to attend. Its with another department within Daimler. 
Meeting was at 10:00 AM, and we were leaving from office 
around 9:20 AM. So we got into a brand new C class Mercedes. 
Counter part took the riders position, and navigated to Esslingen. Off we leave Stuttgart, 
and passed the city roads to enter Autobahn. We could see the greeneries on both side. 
And sometimes some AMGs and MSports swishing next to us. Autobahn is the only road(I know of), 
where there is no upper speed limit. Yes literally you could go on any speed. And we reached the 
destination at 9:50 AM. Even google maps is punctual here. 
One thing in particular we see in Germany(and German organizations) is the punctuality. 
If the meeting starts at 10:00 AM,  then 10:01 AM is a late time.

#### German foods

Afternoon I try to eat at cafeteria mostly. German food. Food is a bit expensive if we compare to Indian price.
It will be like 7 to 15 Euro average after employee discount. 
I really liked German cuisine. Its less spicy, healthy and tasty.

#### Why travels are important?

Generally it will be more of meetings when you are at Germany. Meetings where we plan the next release in detail. 
Working with counterparts closely help in understanding the problem's depth. Interacting with end users provides
clear perspective of their expectation. We may get subtle feature requests from end users, which we might not even consider as user story.
But lots of these tiny subtle features combined gives a user experience, where user feels fun to use. 
I feel travels is one of the best strategy for enriched development. For sure, am gonna miss the post COVID travels.

## Mentoring

People I have mentored at MBRDI were bright and enthusiastic. I was lucky to have such great mentees to be mentored. 
I wish all of them to have a great career path ahead.
I love mentoring. For me mentoring is a two way channel. We will have a lot to teach and learn from the mentees. 

I feels every team's growth relies on the youngsters in the team. If graduates or freshers are joining, 
we have to take responsibility to ensure that they are learning things in right direction. 
I have seen people getting mentored in wrong direction
and become stubborn to learn things the right way. 

> Its important to learn, its more important to know how to un learn things.

### Being mentee
The astonishing journey at Daimler gave me a chance to interact with some of the awesome people within Daimler. 
Priceless knowledge learned from the mentors have affected the way I used to work. 
I would like to express all the counter parts, managers, leads and other colleagues a sincere thanks from bottom of my heart.

# Good Bye Daimler

Saying good bye to Daimler is hard. In fact, it was very tough to take this decision. But when our options are limited, we may need to 
take a choice.

Nevertheless there were countless great things happened in my life, at Daimler. May be I will categorize and list few.

### Takeaways from MBRDI.
* Learned to respect time.
* Take calculated risks.
* Have larger vision of the project.
* Understand business requirement, its as important as coding.
* Plan more and do less. Do not plan less and do more.

### Good things happened when am at MBRDI.
* Became father.
* Bought first vehicle.
* Visited Europe.
* Consecutive departmental awards - 2020 & 2021.
* Colleagues whom I don't forget for a life time.

### Things that didn't moved well!
* Keeping up with the technology trend.

### Why you should work for MBRDI?
* Great office and infrastructure.
* Work life balance.
* Lots of learning opportunities out side the project.
* Employee friendly HR policies.
* Travels to Germany.
* Free Food - Breakfast, launch, evening snacks and dinner.

> Danke Daimler.
