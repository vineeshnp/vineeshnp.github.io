The Microsoft Machine Learning & Data Sciences Conference was the place to discover
how machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies are helping build an intelligent world.

Let me take you readers to the atmosphere that
we had at [#IndiaMLMeet](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IndiaMLMeet). Coming to a
little background, Microsoft announced the conference and opened registration.
We came to know about this from our CEO [Amit](https://twitter.com/amit0). As we know that machine learning is gonna be a cardinal part of future, we were too eager to register.
After couple of days, selected candidates got  awesome
welcome letter. And yeah, Rest was waiting till 08th of
August 2016, for the event to kick off.


## Day 1 Keynote and Kicking off Hackathon

We left to the ITC Gardenia- one of the finest hotel in bangalore - early morning.
 Booked an UBER Taxi.Waited for half an hour, often its hard to get UBER in morning. We gave up and  took an auto-rikshaw.

Upon reaching [ITC](http://www.itchotels.in/hotels/itcgardenia.aspx), we passed the main gate, and stepped forward. The reception was excellent, and registration was
well organized. There were several registration desk. We were suppose to
get in touch with the one which has starting alphabet of your company. We were
from [Techjini](http://www.techjini.com) thus we went to registration
desk T - Z .

Upon registration Microsoft provided basic booklet, pen, food coupon, etc... just
saying, the quality of everything was impressive. And we headed towards the top floor, called Botania. Breakfast was served there.

Keynote began exactly at 9:00 AM IST by addressing, why we need
Machine Learning. India is a country of farmers. The recent changes
in climate is affecting the yield of crops. Our farmers and ancestors know the time
of farming, based on the season. And now with sharp curves on climatic characteristics
the optimum environment required for good yield isn't the time based on season.
Thus an algorithm written to solve a situation like this, can predict what is the
right time for seeding. What is the best time for harvesting. And with IoT integration
to this, it can even predict at what ratio water and fertilizers should be provided to
the crop. The interesting thing is it’s already started in Andra Pradesh(India).

We got another delegate from Rolls-Royce. He was demonstrating how RR uses machine
learning to predict the aircraft engine failure based on number of parameters read
from the engine across time to time. Coming to the medical field, machine learning
can be used to predict the chances of health risk by going through history of medical examination
data of the patient.

Thus Machine Learning can impact our future. We may be able to do farming which
may give maximum yield irrespective of climatic changes. We may have new treatment
methods for immunodeficiency and cancer. And self driving vehicles, intelligent
traffic management system, Smart natural calamity warning systems ,etc...

### Hackathon
Around noon we started with our Hackathon. We were a team of 5, trying to built
a platform that could detect, `if a teenager needs attention`. I know it seems
crazy when hearing it for first time. To brief, we were trying to build a platform which
will process photos of a person across a week[arbitrary time] and says, is
there is any possibility that this guy need attention/help to overcome from emotional
Challenges. We are living in a time where parents and teachers couldn’t pay enough attention to there kids/students. These minor neglecting may create irreversible changes in our life, that could be avoided with a very little time of our life. This was our attempt to address this issue with the aid of machine learning.

Our team was so confident about the project. Each of us got going with each corner
of the project. We were trying to make use of Microsoft emotion API's, which will
gives us details of emotions of a face. And that data will be fed to
our algorithm. The algorithm will predict an `attention Index`, If the attention index is above 50, that person needs attention, and if it is above 80 then there is definitely something serious going around. The algorithm will learn from each verified results.

24 Hours went like a blizz. Coffee and code, code and coffee. Finally our prototype
was ready. We presented it, but we couldn't get into top ten. Nevertheless the media
person from Microsoft called our team for an interview. Even though we couldn't make it to the top, we learned so much things
from Hackathon, that we may never learn inside the boundaries of our cubicle

## Day 2 Networking and Closing

Was honored to be a part of such ab event. We got chance to meet Machine Learning
exerts from different domains. At the end of the day not only we got Machine Learning
exposure, but also a good network of friends. Thank you [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com)
and [Techjini](http://www.techjini.com)
